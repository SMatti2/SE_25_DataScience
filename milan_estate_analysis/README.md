# Milan Estate Analysis

The project analyzes the trends in rent and sale prices per square meter of housing in Milan, Italy, using data from the OMI (Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare) from 2012 to 2022. The analysis includes an examination of the changes in average prices and the variability of prices across neighborhoods.

Additionally, the project compares the sale price per square meter in 2022 with the nightly rates of Airbnb listings in each neighborhood. The goal is to determine whether there is a relationship between the sale price per square meter and Airbnb prices. This analysis may shed light on the impact of Airbnb on the housing market in Milan, and whether it contributes to rising prices in certain neighborhoods.
